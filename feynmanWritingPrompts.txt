Feynman Writing Prompts

1. for loop =
    A for loop can execute a piece of code many times, each time using a different value.
    You state in your for loop a condition, which must be true for the loop to continue executing code.
    Once this condition becomes false, the loop stops.

2.  && = And operator, returns true when both expressions are true.
    || = OR operator, returns true if at least one of the expressions are true.
    ! = Not operator, returns true for false statements and false for true statements.

3.  Array =
    An array is variable that can hold many values in a single variable.

4.  Git =
    Git is a version control system. Git stores snapshots of versions of your code.
    You can roll back your code to a previous working version at any time, and makes collaborating easy.
    When a change is made it can be reviewed and merged into the working branch of code.
    Fork, write code, merge, repeat. With all modifications along the way are stored.

5.  GitHub =
    GitHub is a git interface. It allows you to store your git versions. It focuses on collaboration.
    Forking is a main feature of GitHub, it allows you to make a copy of a project you don't have write access to.
    You can then make changes or improvements and send a 'pull request', to the owner who can then merge the versions.
    This makes open source code collaboration very efficient.
